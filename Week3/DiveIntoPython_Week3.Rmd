## Classes

Data types we've learned about previously are classes in python.

We can use `type` to check the class of an object:

```{python}
num = 13.0
print(type(num))
```

Function `isinstance` allows to check if the object belongs to a certain class:

```{python}
num = 13
isinstance(num, int)

numbers = {}
isinstance(numbers, dict)
```

We can define class as follows:

```{python}
class Human:
    pass #does nothing
#or
class Robot:
    """This class allows to make robots""" #documentation

print(Robot)

print(dir(Robot))
```

Even newly created classes have quite a few pre-defined methods.

Let's create a class `Planet`, and an object of this class `planet`

```{python}
class Planet:
    pass
    
planet = Planet()
print(planet)
```

We can create a list of `Planet` class objectS:

```{python}
solar_system = []
for i in range(8):
    planet = Planet()
    solar_system.append(planet)

print(solar_system) 
```

Class instances are hashable, so we can use them as keys in a dictionary:

```{python}
solar_system = {}
for i in range(8):
    planet = Planet()
    solar_system[planet] = True

print(solar_system)
```

The way we've defined the objects in the list means that none of the planets have their own names/specific properties. We can redefine those using method `__init__`:

```{python}
class Planet:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

earth = Planet("Earth")
print(earth.name)
print(earth)

```

To make `print` of the class object more meaningful we can redefine method `__str__`

```{python}
class Planet:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name


earth = Planet("Earth")
print(earth)
```

So now we can apply that to a list:

```{python}
solar_system = []

planet_names = [
    "Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", 
    "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"
]

for name in planet_names:
    planet = Planet(name)
    solar_system.append(planet)

print(solar_system)
```

Unfortunately defining them in a list invokes another method __repr__. To fix this we can do the following:

```{python}
class Planet:
    
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Planet {self.name}"
        
solar_system = []

planet_names = [
    "Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", 
    "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"
]

for name in planet_names:
    planet = Planet(name)
    solar_system.append(planet)

print(solar_system)
```

We can also modify the attributes of a class:

```{python}
mars = Planet("Mars")
print(mars)

mars.name

mars.name = "Second Earth?"
mars.name
```

If the attribute doesn't exist, we'll get an error:
```{python}
mars.mass
```

Similar thing would happen if we delete the attribute and then refer to it:

```{python}
del mars.name

mars.name
```
